Ongoing implementation of code examples from "Learning Core Audio" by Chris Adamson and Kevin Avila. Taking this at my own pace and restructing or otherwise modifying code as I see fit. Making this public in case anyone else could benefit from this.

As of this date, there is at least one other GitHub repo with the sample code from this book (https://github.com/abbood/Learning-Core-Audio-Book-Code-Sample). I'm doing this as a learning exercise for myself, and as such, my implementations may differ slightly (or significantly) from the code in that repo.
